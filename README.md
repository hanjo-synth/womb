WOMB Bassline
WOMB is a random bassline generator script for Monome Norns, created by HANJO (Tokyo, Japan).
It generates 16-step bassline patterns synced to Norns' internal clock, with real-time control over scale, root note, and note density. WOMB can output sound internally via the PolyPerc engine or externally via MIDI over USB.
